# Fawry Rise Journey Internship Program

This is my solution for the Fawry Rise Journey Internship Program.
In addition to the solution, I added tests to ensure the program works as expected.
To run this code, ensure you have at least Node 18 installed. 

 Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shenawy29/fawry.git
cd fawry
```

Download dependencies: 

```bash
npm install
```


(Optional) Run tests: 

```bash
npm run test
```

Run code (this runs src/index.ts) :

```bash
npm run start
```
